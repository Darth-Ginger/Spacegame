# Project Objectives for Core Mechanics Development - ID: POCM2024

**1. Grid-Based Tactical Combat System**
   - **Objective:** Finalize the combat grid and mechanics including movement, attack ranges, and special abilities.
   - **Status:** Already in progress; refine based on existing implementation details.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Develop and refine the card and deck mechanics for managing combat actions.
     - Implement and test turn-based combat rules, including initiative and turn order.
     - Design and integrate environmental factors and obstacles on the combat grid.

**2. Card and Deck Mechanics for Combat**
   - **Objective:** Fully integrate the card system into combat and navigation decisions.
   - **Status:** Already in progress; expand and optimize the system.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Create a system for deck building and management that players will use to customize strategies.
     - Implement a variety of cards representing different actions, abilities, and movements.
     - Develop mechanics for card draw, hand limits, and recycling of the deck.

**3. Exploration and Encounter System**
   - **Objective:** Design and develop the procedural generation system for star systems and encounters.
   - **Status:** Conceptualized; begin formal development.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Develop algorithms for procedural generation of star systems and sectors.
     - Integrate the encounter system with the navigation, ensuring that each system visit yields unique events.
     - Create a variety of encounter types (combat, puzzle, NPC interactions) and their integration into the game's story and progression.

**4. Ship Management and Progression System**
   - **Objective:** Develop a detailed system for ship upgrades, customization, and crew management.
   - **Status:** Already in progress; continue development and add new features.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Enhance the ship customization interface to allow for detailed modifications and upgrades.
     - Implement a progression system for crew abilities and ship enhancements.
     - Integrate the ship management system with the game’s meta-progression to affect overall gameplay and strategy.

**5. User Interface Development for Core Systems**
   - **Objective:** Design and implement user interfaces for combat, exploration, and ship management.
   - **Status:** Partially started; needs expansion and integration with newly developed features.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Design intuitive and informative UIs for the combat system, highlighting cards, ship status, and tactical options.
     - Create navigation and exploration interfaces that are easy to use and provide necessary information for decision-making.
     - Develop detailed interfaces for ship customization and crew management, ensuring clarity and ease of use.

**6. Technical Infrastructure for Core Mechanics**
   - **Objective:** Establish a robust technical foundation to support core gameplay mechanics, focusing on performance and scalability.
   - **Status:** Ongoing; continuous improvement and optimization.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Optimize the game’s architecture to handle complex calculations and data management efficiently.
     - Ensure the save system is robust and integrates seamlessly with the game’s core mechanics.
     - Test and refine the input system to ensure smooth gameplay across different platforms and devices.
