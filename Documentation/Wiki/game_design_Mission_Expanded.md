# Mission Structure in a Game

## 1. Embarkation

The player selects a mission from a mission map in the hub world, choosing a squad of four ships, each with unique capabilities and roles.
Before departure, players can equip their ships with items, weapons, and special abilities/cards that might be needed for anticipated encounters.

## 2. Exploration Phase

### Navigation

The player moves their squad through a network of systems (analogous to rooms in Darkest Dungeon), choosing paths that lead to different encounters. The map layout is revealed gradually or is partially known beforehand, depending on the mission type.

### Encounters Between Systems

As the squad travels between systems, they may encounter random events, such as:

- **Ambushes:** Sudden combat encounters requiring the player to defend against unexpected foes.
- **Distress Signals:** Offering the choice to assist, ignore, or exploit a situation, affecting resources, morale, or reputation.
- **Anomalies:** Strange phenomena that can have beneficial, harmful, or mysterious effects on the squad or individual ships.
- **Resource Finds:** Opportunities to gather extra fuel, ammunition, or special items.

### System Encounters

Each system has a guaranteed encounter, which could be:

- **Combat:** Engage with enemy forces using the grid-based tactical combat system.
- **Puzzles:** Logic or environmental puzzles that need to be solved to progress, unlock rewards, or avoid traps.
- **NPC Interactions:** Dialogues or negotiations with other characters or factions, affecting the mission's outcome, story progression, or squad morale.

## 3. Encounters Phase

- **Combat Encounters:** Detailed in the previous example, where strategic decisions in grid-based tactical combat play out.
- **Puzzle Encounters:** Require solving puzzles under certain constraints, which could affect resources or the squad's state (e.g., hacking a system to disable traps or deciphering an alien language to avoid a conflict).
- **Roleplay/NPC Interaction Encounters:** Decisions made during these encounters can lead to various outcomes, like gaining allies, acquiring unique items, or triggering additional missions.

## Integration of Mission Components

- **Dynamic Mission Flow:** The mission structure should allow for a fluid transition between exploration and encounters, maintaining a sense of unpredictability and engagement. The outcomes of encounters should impact the state of the squad and the options available in subsequent exploration phases.
- **Variability and Replayability:** Different mission parameters (such as objectives, enemy types, and environmental conditions) and random elements ensure that each mission provides a unique experience. This is crucial for player retention and engagement.
- **Narrative Integration:** Story elements and world-building should be woven into the mission structure, providing context for the player’s actions and making the world feel alive and reactive to the player’s decisions.

This mission structure promotes a balance between strategy, resource management, and narrative engagement, offering players a rich and varied gameplay experience that remains compelling over time.
