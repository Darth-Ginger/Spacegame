# Game Design Document for Spacegame

## 1. Game Overview

- **Title:** Spacegame (tentative, based on the repository name; could be finalized later)
- **Genre:** Tactical Strategy / Science Fiction
- **Themes:** Exploration, survival, and fleet command in a procedurally generated universe.
- **Target Platforms:** Developed for PC with potential for multi-platform expansion.
- **Technical Requirements:** Developed in Unity using C# with an emphasis on modular design using ScriptableObjects. Flexible control schemes are planned through Unity's new input system.

## 2. Gameplay Mechanics

- **Core Gameplay:**
  - **Grid-Based Tactical Combat:** Turn-based mechanics where players control a fleet of starships on a grid system. Players utilize a card-based system to manage combat actions, allowing them to select abilities and maneuvers from a deck of cards. This introduces strategic depth as players must build and manage their decks to suit their tactical preferences and the challenges they face.
  - **Exploration and Encounters:** Players navigate through procedurally generated star systems, encountering random and structured events. These encounters may involve combat scenarios, NPC interactions, or resource gathering, with some influenced by the players' deck composition and previous choices.

- **Ship Management and Progression:**
  - Ships can be customized and upgraded in terms of armaments, technology, and crew. Players also develop and refine their card decks as part of the progression system. This not only enhances ship abilities but also expands tactical options available in combat.

## 5. Technical Architecture

- **Game Engine:** Unity, chosen for its robust support for complex graphical interfaces and ease of integrating custom scripts and assets.
- **Input System:** Implementation of Unity's new input system to support various control schemes and ensure accessibility.
- **Save System:** Developing a robust save system that supports both auto-save and manual save options to capture player progress across multiple sessions.
- **Database Management:** Utilizing ScriptableObjects for efficient management of game data, such as ship stats, item inventories, and mission data, allowing for easy updates and scalability.

## 6. User Interface and Experience

- **UI Layout:**
  - Combat UI includes information panels displaying ship status, abilities, and tactical options.
  - Ship management interfaces allow for the customization and upgrading of ships' components and crew.
  - Exploration UI provides a map and navigation tools, along with interfaces for encountering events and choices.

- **UX Flow:**
  - Ensuring a seamless transition between different game phases (combat, exploration, base management).
  - Intuitive menu systems for game settings, progress checks, and mission briefings.
  - Responsive design considerations to ensure that UI elements are accessible across different device resolutions and input methods.
